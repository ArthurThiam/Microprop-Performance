Overview of required modules:

- numpy
- plotly
- scipy
- pyqt5
- pandas

All modules can be installed using pip install 'module_name'

Notes:

- The filter option might throw an error whenever few data-points are plotted on the x-axis
- The current maximum value of some input boxes is limited and will be changed later. if larger values are required the issue can be circumvented by plotting more instances of a
  certain variable, or by increasing the step size.
